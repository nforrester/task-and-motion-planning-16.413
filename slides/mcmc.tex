  \frametitle{Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm}
  \begin{center}
    Draws samples from any probability distribution, as long as a function
    proportional to the probability distribution is known
    \vspace{4em}

    Very useful in Bayesian inference for non-conjugate posteriors
    \[P(x|h) \propto P(h|x) P(x)\]
